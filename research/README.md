# Ethereum Substate Recorder/Replayer
Ethereum substate recorder/replayer based on the paper:

**Yeonsoo Kim, Seongho Jeong, Kamil Jezek, Bernd Burgstaller, and Bernhard Scholz**: _An Off-The-Chain Execution Environment for Scalable Testing and Profiling of Smart Contracts_,  USENIX ATC'21

To build all programs, simply run `make all`.
You can find all executables including `geth` and our `substate-cli` in `build/bin/` directory.

## Substate Data Structures
There are 5 data structures stored in a substate DB:
1. `SubstateAccount`: account information (nonce, balance, code, storage)
2. `SubstateAlloc`: mapping of account address and `SubstateAccount`
3. `SubstateEnv`: information from block headers (block gasLimit, number, timestamp, hashes)
4. `SubstateMessage`: message for transaction execution
5. `SubstateResult`: result of transaction execution

5 values are required to replay transactions and validate results:
1. `InputAlloc`: alloc that is read during transaction execution
2. `Env`: block information required for transaction execution
3. `Message`: array with exactly 1 transaction
4. `OutputAlloc`: alloc that is generated by transaction execution
5. `Result`: execution result and receipt array with exactly 1 receipt

The first 2 bytes of a key in a substate DB represent different data types as follows:
1. `1s`: Substate, a key is `"1s"+N+T` with transaction index `T` at block `N`.
`T` and `N` are encoded in a big-endian 64-bit binary.
2. `1c`: EVM bytecode, a key is `"1c"+codeHash` where `codeHash` is Keccak256 hash of the bytecode.

## Record transaction substates
Here is a simple way how to record substates.
1. Download the unmodified Geth client that this repository is based on.
For example, you can find in release notes that record-replay `rr0.3.2` is based on Geth `v1.10.15`.
2. Sync **the unmodified Geth** up to the block which you want to record and replay.
Geth full/snap sync will download blocks from the genesis block.
3. Export blocks using **the unmodified Geth**.
For example, `geth export ethereum.blockchain` to export from the genesis block to the latest synced block.
4. Import the exported blocks using **the `geth import` from record-replay** from scratch.
For example, `geth --datadir new.ethereum import ethereum.blockchain` to import and record the exported blocks from the unmodified Geth.

If you want to record a specific range of blocks `X-Y`, you need the (unmodified) Geth database whose head block is `X-1`, and blocks `X-Y` exported to a file.
If you don't have the Geth database at block `X-1`, then you need to export blocks up to `X-1` with the unmodified Geth, and import it from scratch again.

The output directory specified by `--substatedir` (default: `substate.ethereum`) is the substate DB.
The directory is a single LevelDB instance, so you must read or write the substate DB with `github.com/syndtr/goleveldb` module.
The substate DB may be corrupted if you directly write or modify any files in the directory.
Do not use LevelDB library for other languages (C++, Python, etc.) because they are incompatible with the goleveldb module.

## Replay transactions
`substate-cli replay` executes transaction substates in a given block range.
If `substate-cli replay` finds an execution result that is not equivalent to the recorded result,
it returns an error immediately.

For example, if you want to replay transactions from block 1,000,001 to block 2,000,000 in `substate.ethereum`:
```bash
./substate-cli replay 1000001 2000000
```

Here are command line options for `substate-cli replay`:
```
replay [command options] <blockNumFirst> <blockNumLast>

The substate-cli replay command requires two arguments:
<blockNumFirst> <blockNumLast>

<blockNumFirst> and <blockNumLast> are the first and
last block of the inclusive range of blocks to replay transactions.

OPTIONS:
   --workers value      Number of worker threads that execute in parallel (default: 4)
   --skip-transfer-txs  Skip executing transactions that only transfer ETH
   --skip-call-txs      Skip executing CALL transactions to accounts with contract bytecode
   --skip-create-txs    Skip executing CREATE transactions
   --substatedir value  Data directory for substate recorder/replayer (default: "substate.ethereum")
```

For example, if you want 32 workers to replay transactions except CREATE transactions:
```bash
./substate-cli replay 1000001 2000000 --workers 32 --skip-create-txs
```

If you want to replay only CALL transactions and skip the other types of transactions:
```bash
./substate-cli replay 1000001 2000000 --skip-transfer-txs --skip-create-txs
```

If you want to use a substate DB other than `substate.ethereum` (e.g. `/path/to/substate_db`):
```bash
./substate-cli replay 1000001 2000000 --substatedir /path/to/substate_db
```

### Hard-fork assessment
To assess hard-forks with prior transactions, use `substate-cli replay-fork` command. Run `./substate-cli replay-fork --help` for more details:

```
replay-fork [command options] <blockNumFirst> <blockNumLast>

The replay-fork command requires two arguments:
<blockNumFirst> <blockNumLast>

<blockNumFirst> and <blockNumLast> are the first and
last block of the inclusive range of blocks to replay transactions.

--hard-fork parameter is recommended for this command.

OPTIONS:
   --workers value      Number of worker threads that execute in parallel (default: 4)
   --skip-transfer-txs  Skip executing transactions that only transfer ETH
   --skip-call-txs      Skip executing CALL transactions to accounts with contract bytecode
   --skip-create-txs    Skip executing CREATE transactions
   --hard-fork value    Hard-fork block number, won't change block number in Env for NUMBER instruction
                          1: Frontier
                          1150000: Homestead
                          2463000: Tangerine Whistle
                          2675000: Spurious Dragon
                          4370000: Byzantium
                          7280000: Constantinople + Petersburg
                          9069000: Istanbul
                          12244000: Berlin
                          12965000: London (default: 12965000)
   --substatedir value  Data directory for substate recorder/replayer (default: "substate.ethereum")
```

## Substate DB manipulation
`substate-cli db` is an additional command to directly manipulate substate DBs.

### `upgrade`
`substate-cli db upgrade` command converts the old DB layout (`stage1-substate`) used for the USENIX ATC'21 paper to the latest DB layout (`substate.ethereum`).
```
./substate-cli db upgrade stage1-substate substate.ethereum
```

### `clone`
`substate-cli db clone` command reads substates of a given block range and copies them in a substate DB clone.
```
./substate-cli db clone srcdb dstdb 46147 50000
```

### `compact`
`substate-cli db compact` command compacts any LevelDB instance including the substate DB.
```
./substate-cli db compact substate.ethereum
```

## Debugging replayer
You may instrument EVM in our replayer instead of the P2P client to speed up dynamic analysis on EVM bytecode.
In this case, modify and run `substate-cli replay` which checks the EVM output with the recorded output.
If those two outputs are different in `substate-cli replay`, it will print substates formatted in JSON and terminate.
In this case, use `--workers=1` option for sequential transaction execution and identify the block N that causes the problem.
Then, add code that prints values for debugging or use debugging tools.

You may modify EVM specification and want to see the effects of the updates.
It also means that you don't expect that all transactions are faithfully replayed.
In this case, modify and run `substate-cli replay-fork` which checks differences in the outputs and reports them.
